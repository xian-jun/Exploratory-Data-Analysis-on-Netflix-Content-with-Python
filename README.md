# Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix Content with Python

The dataset used in this analysis is titles.csvunder “Netflix TV Shows and Movies” retrieved from Kaggle (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-andmovies?select=titles.csv). The dataset contains a total of 15 unique columns and 5806 observations. Each row records the data of a show or a movie registered in the Netflix database that includes id, title, description, genres, production countries, age certifications, runtime, etc. 


The dataset was chosen because it is extensive, structured and complete but still requires some data cleaning and preparation required by the group project. Extensive analysis is carried out on the dataset to help executives in Netflix to customise the platform’s future content accordingly. In the case of machine learning, The dataset also allows us to conduct clustering analysis.

This project covers data cleaning and wrangling, exploratory analytics, visualisation and machine learning using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn.

## Research Questions

In this project, the content (shows and movies) are perused carefully to allow for the executives in the company to customize the platform’s future content accordingly. Research questions are asked to dive into the discourse: 
1. Do clients like movie or show? 
2. How do TV series do in general? 
3. Which genres of shows and movies are the most popular among the clients? 
4. What is the distribution of content from different production countries? 
5. What are the most popular age certifications for content on Netflix? 
6. How can the data be grouped for clustering analysis?
